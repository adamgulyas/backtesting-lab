As false as this is, it ends up being a self-fulfiling prophecy where if enough people follow a similar strategy, patterns in the market will emerge that are somewhat reliable. In our algorithm, we rely on statistics to inform us about how the market is moving. We use the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), the Slow Moving Average (SMA), Moving Average Convergaence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands to determine where the stock is currently headed (up or down) and by how much. If the algorithm sees that the stock is moving upward and is trading close to the mean closing price, that would produce a signal to buy the stock. If the stock is trending up but is more than one standard deviation away from the mean (at the upper end of the Bollinger Band), that would produce a signal to sell.')
